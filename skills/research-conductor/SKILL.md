description: Autopilot that drives a Stats/ML research idea from rough intuition to a submission-ready paper by automatically sequencing the other three skills (literature-explorer, algo-brainstorm, paper-writer). Reads the research-state stage machine and calls the right mode next, looping until the paper is done. Use when the user says "I have an idea, take it to a paper", "drive the whole pipeline", "from idea to paper", "把這個想法做成論文", "幫我從頭跑到投稿", or invokes /research. NOT for running a single isolated mode — use /explore, /algo, or /write for that.

# research-conductor

The **conductor** for this plugin. The other three skills each do one stage of
research; this one *sequences* them. You start from an idea, and it decides which
skill/mode to invoke next, runs it, and loops — so you complete a paper without
hand-driving every step.

It is a thin orchestration layer. It **never** re-implements mode logic, **never**
writes a mode-owned section of research-state, and **never** bypasses a gate. It
reads the `stage` that modes already write and delegates execution back to them.

## When to invoke

- "I have an idea for a new method — help me take it all the way to a paper"
- "Drive the pipeline", "what's the next step?", "keep going"
- `/research <idea>` (new idea) or `/research` (resume current project)

## When NOT to invoke

- One isolated stage → use `/explore`, `/algo <mode>`, `/write <mode>` directly.
- The user is mid-discussion inside a single mode and just wants that mode.

## The loop

```
1. Resolve project:
     - new idea with no state  → run bootstrap.md (create state, pick start stage)
     - existing .research-state/<slug>.md → load it
2. Render the roadmap (checklist from `stage`; see "Roadmap" below).
3. Pick the next mode from routing.md (stage → next, with branches/loop-backs).
4. Announce the hop in ONE line: "▶ <stage> → <next mode> (<why>)".
5. Load and execute that mode file (skills/<skill>/modes/<mode>.md or the
   literature-explorer pipeline). The mode owns its own grill, gating, and
   state-writes — let it run exactly as if invoked directly.
6. When the mode finishes, re-read research-state.
     - hard stop hit?  → halt, hand control to the user (see "Hard stops").
     - else            → go to 2.
7. Stop when `stage: final` (summarize artifacts) or a hard stop fires.
```

The substance of steps 1 and 3 lives in the two sub-files — read them when you
reach those steps:

- `bootstrap.md` — turn a fresh idea into a state file and a starting stage.
- `routing.md` — the `stage → next mode` table, branch rules, loop-backs, and the
  bib-before-novelty precondition.

### Hop checklist (every loop iteration)

Verify before each hop — per `shared/prompts/execution_discipline.md`
(rule 6 especially; the loop runs long and memory of state goes stale):

- [ ] `.research-state/<slug>.md` re-read from disk **this turn**, not
      recalled from earlier context.
- [ ] Completeness rule applied (routing.md): the stage's own mode runs iff
      its output is missing; otherwise its successor.
- [ ] Hard-stop list scanned against the fresh state; none firing.
- [ ] Roadmap printed; hop announced in one line.

## Autonomy

Default: **full auto until blocked.** Auto-chain stage→stage; only the hard stops
below (or the user) pause the run. Two opt-down flags from `/research`:

- `--gates` — also pause for a one-line go/no-go at high-leverage gates: candidate
  pick (after `ideate`), novelty verdict, red-team triage, before `full-draft`,
  before `submission-check`.
- `--step` — pause before every mode.

Full auto is **not silent**: announce every hop (step 4) so the user can interject.

### Standing-confirmation semantics

Schema rule #3 (`shared/research_state.schema.md`) says advance `stage` only on
user confirmation. A conductor run supplies that confirmation **once, up front**:
during the run, modes may advance `stage` without re-asking. This override is
scoped to the conductor and applies to stage advancement **only** — it does not
touch grills or any hard stop.

## Hard stops (halt even in full auto)

Halt, state why in one line, and hand control back when:

- A mode needs its grill (`shared/prompts/grill_protocol.md`) and no
  `interview_<mode>:` block exists yet → let the mode run its interview; the
  conductor waits for the user, then resumes.
- A refuse-if-blank precondition fails and can't be auto-backfilled (e.g.
  `paper-writer` pre-flight, `gap-analysis` "no method specified").
- `novelty-check` verdict is *not novel* or *novelty uncertain* unresolved.
- `red-team` has a `blocking: true` / high-severity finding → do **not** advance to
  `outline`; route back per routing.md.
- `citation-audit` returns any `fabricated` or `mismatched`.
- `submission-check` fails.
- An API/tool failure (`unreachable`), or an anti-hallucination `[VERIFY]` that
  gates an irreversible step (`shared/prompts/anti_hallucination.md`).
- The user types `stop` / `pause` / "等一下" — halt immediately after the current
  mode; the persisted `stage` lets the next `/research` resume.

After any halt, the user resolves the issue (answers the grill, fixes a finding,
re-runs a mode by hand) and says "continue" / `/research` to resume.

## Roadmap

At step 2, print a compact checklist derived from `stage` (the source of truth),
so the auto-run stays legible. Mark `✅` done, `▶` current, `⬜` pending. Example:

```
explore ✅  gap ✅  formalize ✅  ideate ▶  novelty ⬜  theory ⬜
toy ⬜  ablation ⬜  red-team ⬜  outline ⬜  draft ⬜  review ⬜
audit ⬜  submission ⬜  final ⬜
```

Show only the branch that applies (theory vs toy/ablation) per routing.md.

## State discipline

The conductor writes research-state **only** during bootstrap (topic / slug /
venue_target / created / initial `stage`). Everything after that is written by the
modes it calls. It must obey the schema's atomic-update and append-only rules and
must not duplicate a mode's grill (see `grill_protocol.md` "Failure modes").
